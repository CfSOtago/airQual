## airQual: exploration of air quality data

__Best viewed at https://cfsotago.github.io/airQual/__

Poor air quality is well known to have both chronic (long term) and acute (short term) impacts on [health](http://www.erg.kcl.ac.uk/Research/home/projects/personalised-health-impacts.html).

### New Zealand

See https://www.mfe.govt.nz/air

New Zealand homes use a mixture of solid (coal/wood), electric (fueled by [hydro/coal/gas/geothermal/wind](https://cfsotago.github.io/gridCarbon)) and reticulated (mains) / bottled gas [heating](https://www.branz.co.nz/cms_display.php?st=1&pg=20015&sn=378&forced_id=yes). The prevalance of solid fuels, especially in regions which suffer winter temperature inversions is a particular [problem](https://www.niwa.co.nz/news/students-scientists-citizens-study-arrowtowns-ailing-air).

As a result, switching to low emissions forms of heating (electric) and/or increasing insluation (or building to [Passive](https://passivehouse.nz/) house standards) will both reduce GHG emissions and improve air quality. As a consequence [health impacts](https://www.bmj.com/content/334/7591/460.short) and [costs](https://jech.bmj.com/content/63/4/271.short) are reduced - an excellent example of the co-benefits of de-carbonising heat. Rather than [non-energy energy policy](http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/publications/impact-of-non-energy-policies-on-energy-systems.html), we therefore have non-health health policy...

Of course, as elsewhere, fossil-fuel based transport is also a major contributor to poor air quality.

### Southampton (UK)

See https://www.southampton.gov.uk/environmental-issues/pollution/air-quality/

Southampton homes are much less likely to use solid fuel heating. Instead they tend to rely on reticulated (mains) gas, electricity and in [some areas](https://datashine.org.uk/#table=QS415EW&col=QS415EW0007&ramp=YlOrRd&layers=BTTT&zoom=12&lon=-1.4252&lat=50.9258), district heating. However gas boilers are known sources of Nitrogen Dioxide so heating systems may also be a contributor to poort air quality in Southampton alongside fossil-fuel based transport.

### Comparative

Southampton and Dunedin have much in common:

 * deep water port relatively close to the CBD
 * major transport routes bisecting the city
 * major flows of commuters, passengers & freight to/from and through the city
 * maritime temperate climate
 * substantial student population
 
How does their air quality compare?

 #YMMV
